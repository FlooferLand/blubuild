_The modern home of computer animated animatronics_

Blubuild is a simulation and animation engine built from the ground up for animatronic shows the likes of [The Rockafire Explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SeSavNd9_c&list=PLB8A625C54121DA04). Blubuild lets you create and animate shows without investing hundreds of dollars making real animatronics, as well as letting you animate real world animatronics by exporting a selection of shows to an Arduino-compatible board or using one as a relay.

## Planned features
- Create and watch shows
- Create mechs/figures using Blender or any other modeling software.
- Live animation editor, as well as a fully-fledged ProgramBlue-level editor
- A safe sandboxed scripting system that allows for users to make things the likes of a show selector
- Online features such as a place to download user-made figures, costume pieces, scriptable props, shows for specific bands, band packs, etc.
- Flatscreen + VR support
- Multiplayer
- Planned singleplayer story mode, with tiny included spookies.
- Good performance on low-end systems, and a built-in video renderer to let you export out shows as smooth 60 FPS video on the highest quality preset even on a potato system.
- Available on Linux, Mac, Windows, and web _(at some point in the future)_

## NOTE: This is _NOT_ a Rockafire Explosion simulator
Rockafire Explosion or CEC characters will _not_ be included in the base game _(unless Aaron specifically gives this project permission)_
There may be private builds of the game including them at some point in the future.
